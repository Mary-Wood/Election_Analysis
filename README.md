# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
For this project, the scenario was as follows: A Colorado Board of Elections employee have me the task of completing an election audit for a recent local congressional election. 

The tasks included: 
  1. Calculate the total number of votes cast
  2. Get the complete list of candidates who had received votes
  3. Calculate the number of votes that each candidate received
  4. Calculate the percentage of votes that each candidate received
  5. Determine the election winner based on popular vote. 

## Resources
Data source: election_results.csv
Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio code 1.38.1

-The county with the highest voter turn out was Denver, with 84.8% or 306,055 votes cast. 

## Election Audit Summary 
This base code could be altered to be used with almost any election that was calculated in a similarly structured CSV file. Edits could be made to the base code to calculate the voter turn out to certain polling locations. This information could help to inform on which areas may need an increased number of polling locations or extended hours to accomodate voter numbers. 
This code could also be altered to look at more than a single-option ballot, it could be edited to look at more expansive ballots that would include calculations and winners for multiple-option ballots.
